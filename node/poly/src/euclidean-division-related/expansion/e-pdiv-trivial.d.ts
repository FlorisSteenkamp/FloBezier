/**
 * Performs a **trivial pseudo-division** and returns the `quotient` and `remainder`
 * of the pseudo division of `a/b` (a, b both being polynomials) in such a way
 * that all intermediate calculations and the final result are done in â„¤, i.e.
 * performs Euclidean (i.e. long) division on the two given polynomials, a/b,
 * and returns a scaled `r` and `q` in the formula `a = bq + r`, where
 * `degree(r) < degree(b)`. `q` is called the quotient and `r` the remainder.
 *
 * * **precondition:** the coefficients must integers (and also Shewchuk
 * floating point expansions); if they are not they can easily be scaled from
 * floating point numbers to Shewchuk expansions by calling [[scaleFloatsToInts]]
 * or similar before calling this function (recall that all floating point
 * numbers are rational).
 *
 * * Intermediate calculations (and the input coefficients) are done in
 * infinite precision up to overlow (meaning integers can be represented
 * *exactly* up to `2^1024 === 1797...(300 more digits)...37216`) and may
 * thus not be applicable to very high degree polynomials (in which case it is
 * better to use [[bPdivTrivial]])
 *
 * * **precondition:** b !== [], i.e. unequal to the zero polynomial.

 * @param a the polynomial a in the formula a = bq + r; the polynomial is given
 * with coefficients as a dense array of integer Shewchuk expansions from
 * highest to lowest power, e.g. `[[5],[-3],[0]]` represents the
 * polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`
 * @param b the polynomial b in the formula a = bq + r
 * @param positiveMultiplier defaults to false - if set to true then the
 * multiplier (of the coefficients of the dividend)
 * `leadingCoeff(b)^(deg(a)-deg(b)+1)` will be
 * modified to `abs(leadingCoeff(b)^(deg(a)-deg(b)+1))`
