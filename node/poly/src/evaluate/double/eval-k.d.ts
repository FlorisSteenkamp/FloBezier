/**
 * Returns the result of evaluating the given polynomial at `x` such that at least
 * the sign bit is correct *up to 3-times compensated evaluation (K = 4)*, i.e.
 * as if evaluating in double-double-double-double precision.
 *
 * * uses a staggered algorithm, first trying in double precision, then in
 * double-double and finally in double-double-double-double

 * represents the polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`
 * @param x the value at which to evaluate the polynomial
