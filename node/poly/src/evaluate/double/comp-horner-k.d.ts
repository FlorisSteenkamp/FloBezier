/**
 * Returns a result of evaluating a univariate polynomial using K times compensated
 * Horner's method.
 *
 * * K times compensated means the error in the evaluation is reduced by roughly
 * `(1 / Number.EPSILON)**K` which is again roughly `2^(53*K)` - it is the same as using
 * double-double-.... (K times) precision in a normal Horner evaluation
 * * see [Algorithms for Accurate, Validated and Fast Polynomial Evaluation, `Stef Graillat, Philippe Langlois, Nicolas Louvet`](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00285603/document)
 * * for K-times compensated with K <= 4 this is the fastest known method, but
 * the running time grows exponentially with K.

 * @param p a polynomial with coefficients given densely as an array of double
 * floating point numbers from highest to lowest power, e.g. `[5,-3,0]`
 * represents the polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`
 * @param x the value at which to evaluate the polynomial
 * @param K (K - 1) === the number of compensations to do
