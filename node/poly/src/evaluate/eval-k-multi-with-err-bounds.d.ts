/**
 * Returns the result of evaluating the given polynomial at x such that the sign

 * @param p a multi-polynomial, ordered by most significant 'coefficients' first
 * @param pE an error polynomial - all coefficients must be positive
 * @param x an evaluation point
 * @param multiplier the error needs to be a multiple of this number smaller
 * than the evaluated value, otherwise zero is returned
