/**
 * Find and return all roots of the given polynomial in the given interval.
 *
 * * an empty array is returned for a constant or the zero polynomial
 *
 * * **non-exact:** roots are found 'naively' using double-precision arithmetic
 * and accuracy will thus depend on the condition number around the root - use
 * [[allRootsCertifiedSimplified]] or [[allRootsCertified]] instead if certified
 * root bounds are required (it is about 3x slower, but still very fast!)
 *
 * * close (where the definition of closeness depends on the condition
 * number) or multiple *even* roots can be returned as 0, 1 or more close
 * roots, whereas close or multiple *odd* roots are guaranteed to return *at
 * least 1 root*
 *
 * * optimized for polynomials of degree 1 to about 30
 *
 * * roots are refined using the celebrated Brent's Method (and evaluated using
 * Horner's Method) until a root interval is found with
 * width `<= eps * max(1, 2^⌈log₂r⌉)`, where `eps = Number.EPSILON` and
 * `r` is a root
 *
 * * **ordered:** the returned roots are ordered from lowest to highest
 *
 * @param p a polynomial with coefficients given densely as an array of double
 * floating point numbers from highest to lowest power, e.g. `[5,-3,0]`
 * represents the polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`
 * @param lb defaults to `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`; lower bound of roots to be
 * returned
 * @param ub defaults to `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`; upper bound of roots to be
 * returned
