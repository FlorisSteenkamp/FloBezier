/**
 * If the highest power coefficient of the given polynomial is 0 then
 * removeLeadingZeros can be called to remove all such highest terms so that
 * the returned array is a valid presentation of a polynomial.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @param p a polynomial with coefficients given densely as an array of Shewchuk
 * floating point expansions from highest to lowest power, e.g. `[[5],[-3],[0]]`
 * represents the polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * eRemoveLeadingZeros([[1e-18], [1e-10], [1e-1]]); //=> [[1e-18], [1e-10], [1e-1]]
 * eRemoveLeadingZeros([[0], [1e-10], [1e-1]]); //=> [[1e-10], [1e-1]]
 * ```
