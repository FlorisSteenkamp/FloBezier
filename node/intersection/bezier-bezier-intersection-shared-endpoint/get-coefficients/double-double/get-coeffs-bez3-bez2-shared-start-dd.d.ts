/**
 * Returns a polynomial in 1 variable (including coefficientwise error bound)
 * whose roots are the parameter values of the intersection points of an order
 * 3 and 2 bezier curve (i.e. a cubic bezier curve and a quadratic bezier curve) *starting
 * at the same point*, with the (known) root at `t = 0` divided out.
 *
 * The returned polynomial degree will be 5 (i.e. one less than given by
 * [Bézout's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_theorem))
 *
 * The returned polynomial coefficients are given densely as an array of
 * double-double precision floating point numbers from highest to lowest power,
 * e.g. `[[0,5],[0,-3],[0,0]]` represents the polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`.
 *
 * * intermediate calculations are done in double-double precision
 * * the error bound returned still needs to be multiplied by `γγ3`
 * * with the implicit form of `ps1` relative to its start point, `P`, (see
 * [[getImplicitForm3AtStartDd]]) and `ps2(t) - P = t(u(t), w(t))` the polynomial is
 * given by `F₁(u,w) + tF₂(u,w) + t²F₃(u,w)` where `Fₖ` is the degree `k` part
 * of the implicit form:
 *   * `F₁ = vₓu + vᵧw`
 *   * `F₂ = vₓₓu² + vₓᵧuw + vᵧᵧw²`
 *   * `F₃ = vₓₓₓu³ + vₓₓᵧu²w + vₓᵧᵧuw² + vᵧᵧᵧw³`
 * * if the curves are tangent at `P` the constant term is exactly zero
 * * this code was generated (see `research/gen-shared-start.py`)
 *
 * * **precondition:** `ps1[0]` and `ps2[0]` must be exactly equal
 *
 * @param ps1
 * @param ps2
