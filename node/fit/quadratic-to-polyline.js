    // A quad bezier has the following useful properties (Let the control
    // points be labeled P0, P1 and P2 respectively and let the point at t = 0.5
    // be labeled M1):
    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // * At t = 0.5 P1 has its maximum influence of 0.5 and P0 and P2 each an 
    // influence of 0.25.
    // * The tangent at t = 0.5 is given by P2 - P0.
    // * The line implied by the tangent at t = 0.5 cuts the line segments P0-P1
    // and P2-P1 in half. Lets call these points M0 and M2.
    // * The polygon P0-M0-M2-P2 bounds the curve.
    // * The curve can be cut into two quad bezier curves. 
    // * If it is cut at t = 0.5, i.e. at M1 so that we have two quad beziers 
    // defined by the triangles Q1 = P0-M0-M1 and Q2 = M0-M2-P2 then both 
    // the interior angles at P0 and P2 are < 90 degrees (acute). Lets call such
    // a quad acute, otherwise obtuse.
    // * If we split an obtuse quad at t = 0.5 then the resulting quads are both
    // acute.
    // * Acute quads is such that the point at t = 0.5, i.e. at M1) is the 
    // furthest away from the line P0-P2.
    // Note: In our algorithm the above property can be used to measure the 
    // flatness of the quad reliably.
    // The algorithm: q: quad => lines[] such that the Hausdorff distance 
    // between the polyline and the quad < tolerance.
    // Strategy: Use linked list for polyline - makes splitting easier
