###  toHybridQuadratic

▸ **toHybridQuadratic**(`ps`: number[][]): *[[number, number], [[number, number], [number, number]], [number, number]]*

*Defined in [src/transformation/degree-or-type/to-hybrid-quadratic.ts:17](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/FloBezier/blob/6f79660/src/transformation/degree-or-type/to-hybrid-quadratic.ts#L17)*

Returns the hybrid quadratic version of the given cubic bezier. For a
definition of hybrid quadratic bezier curves see this paper:
http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2206&context=etd

**Parameters:**

Name | Type | Description |
------ | ------ | ------ |
`ps` | number[][] | a cubic bezier curve. |

**Returns:** *[[number, number], [[number, number], [number, number]], [number, number]]*

An array of three quadratic bezier points where the
middle point is a 'hybrid' point represented as a line (itself represented
by two points (a linear bezier curve)) which can be evaluated at a different
t value (call it th). If evaluated at the same t value the result is the same
as evaluating the original cubic bezier at t. The set generated by evaluating
the hybrid quadratic curve for all (t,th) value pairs forms a geometric area
bound around the orginal cubic bezier curve. The length of the linear bezier
curve mentioned above is a measure of how closely the cubic can be
represented as a quadratic bezier curve.
