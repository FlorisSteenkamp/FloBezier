## Overview

The focus is to provide a portable, practical, easy-to-use, robust and fast bezier curve
library with zero vendor lock-in.

For example, finding the intersection between a quadratic and cubic bezier curve
should be simple:

```typescript
// some cubic bezier curve given by an array of its control points
const cubic1 = [[6.4, 4.8], [15, 5], [1, 4], [10, 4]];
// another cubic bezier curve
const cubic2 = [[9.4, 0.4], [9.3, 10.3], [8.1, 0.1], [7.53125, 5.5]];
const xs = bezierBezierIntersectionFast(cubic1, cubic2); //=> [[0.054810011880009446, 0.9516779285879586], ...
// xs.length === 9 (nine points of intersections)

// Evaluating the 1st curve at the first intersection gives the point of intersection
const p1 = evaluate(cubic1,xs[0][0]);  //=> [7.617926141015109,  4.822433357454532]
// ... or alternatively evaluating the 2nd curve at the first intersection
const p2 = evaluate(cubic2,xs[0][1]);  //=> [7.6179261410151105, 4.822433357454532]
```

In general, the functions in this library are limited to points, lines, quadratic bezier
curves and cubic bezier curves (i.e. order 0,1,2 and 3 bezier curves) in 2d.

## Features

* **Robust** Based on dozens of research papers (referenced in the docs) and using adaptive multi-precision
floating point operations with strict error-bounding techniques ensures
robust results you can trust.

* **Fast** Special care has been taken to ensure each function performs well not 
only in theory but also in practice.
      
* **Tested** Hundreds of carefully crafted tests and over 99% coverage means you can
use every function with confidence and peace of mind.

* **Freestanding** For maximum interoperability, each function is entirely independent (e.g.
not a method of a class) and takes simple paramters (e.g. a point is just
an array of numbers and a bezier curve is simply represented as an array of points).

* **Accurate** High <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number)">condition numbers </a>
are completely mitigated where necessary without a hit to performance. For example,
bezier curve intersection is <i>guaranteed</i> accurate to 
within <code>4*Number.EPSILON</code> in the returned paramter values.

* **Pure** Every function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure </a>.
The same input to the same function gives the same results - every time. No need
to clog your short term memory by worrying about state of any kind.


## [Documentation](https://florissteenkamp.github.io/FloBezier)
For in-depth interactive documentation please [read the docs!](https://florissteenkamp.github.io/FloBezier).

## Installation

```cli
npm install flo-bezier3
```

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
It can be used in `Node.js` or in a browser.

Additionally, self-contained `ECMAScript Module` (ESM) files `index.js` and
`index.min.js` in the `./browser` folder are provided.

## Usage

Below are usage examples for some common environments. 

Please see the [docs](https://florissteenkamp.github.io/FloBezier) for a complete
list of available functions.

### Node.js
```js
import { fitQuadsToCubic } from 'flo-bezier3';

// some cubic bezier curve given by an array of its control points
const cubic = [[1, 1], [5.125, 8], [15.375, 0.875], [13.6875, 7.71875]];
const quads = fitQuadsToCubic(cubic, 0.1); //=> [[[1, 1], [2.617431640625, 3.5152587890625], ...

if (quads.length === 4) {
    console.log('success! üòÅ');  // we should get to here!
} else {
    console.log('failure! üò•');  // ...and not here
}
```

### Browsers - directly, without a bundler, using the pre-bundled minified .js file

Please note that no tree shaking will take place in this case.

```html
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <script type="module">
        import { fitQuadsToCubic } from "./node_modules/flo-bezier3/browser/index.min.js";

        // some cubic bezier curve given by an array of its control points
        const cubic = [[1, 1], [5.125, 8], [15.375, 0.875], [13.6875, 7.71875]];
        const quads = fitQuadsToCubic(cubic, 0.1); //=> [[[1, 1], [2.617431640625, 3.5152587890625], ...

        if (quads.length === 4) {
            console.log('success! üòÅ');  // we should get to here!
        } else {
            console.log('failure! üò•');  // ...and not here
        }
    </script>
</head>

<body>Check the console.</body>

</html>
```

### Bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, ...)

Webpack will be taken as an example here.

Since your webpack config file might still use `CommonJS` you must rename 
`webpack.config.js` to `webpack.config.cjs`.

If you are using TypeScript:

Since this is an [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)
library you must use [resolve-typescript-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin) 
(at least until webpack catches up with ESM?) in your `webpack.config.cjs` file.

```cli
npm install --save-dev resolve-typescript-plugin
```

and follow the instructions given at [resolve-typescript-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin).

Additionally, follow this [guide](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#how-can-i-make-my-typescript-project-output-esm).
